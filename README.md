I am a Cambridge Mathematics graduate, currently on my second year of a two year master’s in Artificial Intelligence at Maastricht University. After finishing my bachelor’s and first master’s in Mathematics, I started working as a math tutor. At the same time, I independently developed my programming skills in Python and took online courses on the basics of Artificial Intelligence. Having now gained strong theoretical foundations on A.I. through my master’s, I am currently looking for an A.I. related internship in order to get some practical experience in the field. I am interested in areas such as Computer Vision with medical applications, and Natural Language Processing.
